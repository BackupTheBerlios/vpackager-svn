- Some Bugs. See http://vpackager.berlios.de for details
- Changed code to use requiredbuilder instead of makeslapt
- Pulls CFLAGS from ~/.bashrc instead of hard coded value

- Changed the structure of the src directory to make room for gnu tools build system.
- This will allow vpackager to be built / installed in other systems

* Thu Jun 19 2008 M0E-lnx <M0E.lnx@gmail.com> 
- Updated 1.0.14 release that will use the autoconf tools to build into other systems
- Hopefully this will allow vpackager to expand to other slack-derivate distros
