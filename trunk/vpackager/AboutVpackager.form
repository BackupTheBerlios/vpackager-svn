It may work slackware and othe its derivates, but it's not guaranteed, as the program is developed around VectorLinux.<br>\n<h3>Features include but not limited to:</h3>\nCompiling a package a compressed source archive (.tar.gz or .tar.bz2). This feature will build most applications including CMake and python sources* <br><br>\n\nA cruxports4slack front-end that can do most operations allowed by the cruxports4slack set of tools plus the hability to resolve dependancies.
